    "## Loops are okay\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental control structures of computer programming is the loop, which allows executing code repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to programming in other dynamic languages (R, Python, etc.) you've likely been told to avoid using loops at all costs. In those languages, loops are very slow, because they do not know the types of the data structures being operated on in the loops. Instead, you are told to \"vectorize\" - use operations that operate on a whole array of data at once (most `np.` functions in Python, `vapply` in R, etc.). These functions are implemented in efficient native code written in C or C++, and thus avoid the overhead of a loop. In Julia, vectorized operations are available; in fact, any function or operator can be vectorized by adding a .\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're used to programming in static languages (C, Fortran, Java, etc.), using loops is likely second nature. These languages do not suffer from the problems described above. Julia is a mix of static and dynamic, but loops are not in general slow in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, using a loop in Julia is often more efficient than using vectorized operations in either Julia or other languages. In the code below, we're counting up the number of periods where traffic sensors had speeds above or below 30 mph. Using a vectorized operation, you might create two arrays, with ones for each observation where speed is above or below 30 mph, respectively, then sum them. This requires \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if vectorized operations are more readable, there's nothing wrong with using them in Julia - vectorization is also fast in Julia, and the gains from using a loop are marginal and you should only try to optimize for speed over readability if speed really is an issue."
